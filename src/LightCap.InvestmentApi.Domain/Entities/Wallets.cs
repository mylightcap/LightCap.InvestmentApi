        //
        //   PendingRoundUpBalance -> NOT real money. Just a running total of
        //   round-up percentages accumulating toward the ₦1,000 threshold.
        //   Nothing has been pulled from the user's real bank account yet.
        //
        //   AvailableBalance -> REAL money. This only increases once a
        //   DirectPay debit has been confirmed successful - i.e. money has
        //   actually left the user's bank account and landed with LightCap.
        //
        // Never update either balance directly from random places in the code -
        // always go through a WalletTransaction first (the ledger), then update
        // the relevant balance here. The ledger is the source of truth.

        // PendingRoundUpBalance -> NOT real money. Accumulates from small round-up percentages after
        // every detected purchase. Resets toward zero once it crosses the
        // threshold(eg: >= 1000) and a real DirectPay debit is confirmed.

        // AvailableBalance -> REAL money. Only increases when a DirectPay debit is confirmed
        // successful. This is what's actually sitting with LightCap, ready
        // to be sent to the investment partner.
